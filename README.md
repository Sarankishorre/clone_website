This project is a clone of the Wikipedia page of Australian cricketer Marnus Labuschagne, built as a practice exercise to enhance web development skills.
It recreates the layout, styling, and content of the Wikipedia page using HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript while maintaining responsiveness and accessibility.
